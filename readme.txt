First, I wanted to create the layout of the website. I've started with writing the HTML structure:
building the following:
1. navigation bar
2. ribbon
3. 'let the holidays' box 
4. iphone 13 pro box
5. ihone 13
6. container with the 6 boxes (macbook, watch, etc.)
7.footer with the disclaimers, links and copyrights.
Then, I've added divs, text and images within every section above.
Flex was mostly used for inner structuring of every sub section. For example, in the footer, the links for privacy policy untill site map in the last line was constructed within unordered list, then I could make them appear in a row by displaying flex on their container and removing the list style.
Also, I've added after pseudo elements for the '>' nearby every shop gifts or learn more links and fixed some hover effects.
My strategy was to finish the layout of all of the homepage first, and then systematically move to refine the small details inside the divs or the sections.
Grid was used also on the links in the footer, I knew I wanted to create 5 columns for more than 5 uls, so I made 5 divs a-priori to match the grid naturally.
